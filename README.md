# Elegant Breadcrumbs for Next.js

A simple, flexible way to implement breadcrumbs in Next.js.

## Features

### Component-based breadcrumbs

Create a separate breadcrumb component for each page. Breadcrumbs are automatically chained based on your current location—no need to hardcode parent links.

### Automatic link generation

Links are generated automatically, so restructuring your project won’t require manually updating breadcrumbs.

### Dynamic content

Fetch and display dynamic data in your breadcrumbs using route parameters, just like in your pages.

### Unstyled

This library provides a hook instead of a prebuilt component, giving you full control over how your breadcrumbs look.
